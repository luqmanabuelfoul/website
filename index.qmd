I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Government at the LSE. I am supervised by [Professor Steffen Hertog](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government/people/academic-staff/steffen-hertog) and [Dr Omar McDoom](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government/people/academic-staff/omar-mcdoom).

My research broadly focuses on political violence and contentious politics, seeking to examine what factors structure mobilisation. I study this by applying quantitative and computational methods to historical cases. 

My PhD thesis delves into this topic through three papers, the first of which examines how inter-ethnic contact affects mobilisation patterns in Mandatory Palestine.

Outside of my PhD research, I am interested in contention more broadly, as well as how political contention interacts with and is shaped by culture, for which I have published research in the *Journal of Palestine Studies*.

Prior to my PhD, I completed an MPhil in Modern Middle Eastern Studies from the University of Oxford. I also hold a BA in History from the University of Warwick.
