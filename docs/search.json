    "text": "I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Government at the LSE. I am supervised by Professor Steffen Hertog and Dr Omar McDoom.\nMy research broadly focuses on political violence and contentious politics, seeking to examine what factors structure mobilisation. My PhD thesis delves into this topic by examining how inter-ethnic contact affects mobilisation patterns\nOutside of my PhD research, I am interested in contention more broadly, as well as how political contention interacts with and is shaped by culture, for which I have published research in the Journal of Palestine Studies.\nPrior to my PhD, I completed an MPhil in Modern Middle Eastern Studies from the University of Oxford. I also hold a BA in History from the University of Warwick."
