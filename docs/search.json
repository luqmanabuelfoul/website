Examining the development of two masculine identities among the Palestinian youth of Jerusalem—the dod (a transgressive and lumpen-like countercultural figure) and the gada‘ (a brave man who fearlessly confronts the occupier)—through the lyrics of prominent Palestinian rappers, this article argues that these two modes of identification contribute to the creation of new representational politics and spaces of belonging among disaffected Palestinian youth. These developments in turn structure how resistance is understood and practiced by a generation of Palestinians consuming a new wave of Palestinian rap that challenges the neoliberal pacification of Palestinian society."

    "text": "I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Government at the LSE. I am supervised by Professor Steffen Hertog and Dr Omar McDoom.\nMy research broadly focuses on political violence and contentious politics, seeking to examine what factors structure mobilisation. I study this by applying quantitative and computational methods to historical cases.\nMy PhD thesis delves into this topic through three papers, the first of which examines how inter-ethnic exposure affected mobilisation patterns in Mandatory Palestine.\nOutside of my PhD research, I am interested in contention more broadly, as well as how political contention interacts with and is shaped by culture, for which I have published research in the Journal of Palestine Studies.\nPrior to my PhD, I completed an MPhil in Modern Middle Eastern Studies from the University of Oxford. I also hold a BA in History from the University of Warwick."

Prevailing studies of contentious politics and social movements have highlighted the role of expanded political opportunity structures and network effects as important determinants for the onset of contentious activity. This paper extends such analysis by focusing on the understudied role of ethnic tension and exposure in driving contentious activity. Leveraging a novel event dataset of contentious activity during the 1936-1939 Arab Revolt in Palestine, this paper uses a two-stage least squares (2SLS) model with a shift-share instrument to examine how local exposure between two ethnic groups in conflict influences the rate and intensity of contentious activity at the local level. I find that local inter-ethnic exposure is associated with an increase in Palestinian contentious activity, and that this effect is principally driven by a mechanism of resentment – rather than opportunity cost or appropriation. This suggests that Palestinian exposure to Jewish communities may have intensified the destructive and punitive dimensions of Palestinian mobilisation.\n\n\nConflict and Conciliation: Elite Mobilisation and Conflict under the British Mandate of Palestine, 1918-1930\nThe variable effects of repression on mobilisation in Mandatory Palestine"
